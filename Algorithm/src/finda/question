Using the language of your choice, write a function that takes as input a JSON string representing an array of objects, and returns a description of the data format.  Write one or more new test inputs. Provide the function, the test inputs, and the corresponding test outputs.

SAMPLE INPUT
[{name: "Douglas Crawford", salary:80000, address: {line1: "c/o Unstructured Programmers Anonymous", line2: "7723 Western Avenue", city: "San Francisco", state: "CA", zip: "9123"}},
         {name: "Brian Kernighan", salary:60000, address: {line1: "PO BOX 455", city:"Princeton", state:"NJ", zip: "08544"}}]; 

SAMPLE OUTPUT (you choose the format.  This implementer chose to use TypeScript's interface format, augmenting with comments.)
interface inferredJSONFormat {
    name: string,
    salary: number,
    address: IAddress,
}
interface IAddress {
    line1: string,
    line2?: string,
    city: string,
    state: string, // 2 characters
    zip: string, // numeric, 5 digit, 0 padded on left
}
